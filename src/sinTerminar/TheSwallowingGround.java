Now that the wicked is punished, there is still work to do. For example, the ground needs to seal itself
up. (Otherwise, good people will accidentally fall into Hell, which is not good.)
The ground swallowed Don Giovanni by collapsing: Part of the ground collapsed–fell off to Hell–and
this created a gap that swallowed Don Giovanni. The only way the ground can be fixed is by sliding
landmasses to close up the gap. Here is an example. The left diagram shows the ground with a ravine.
Assume that the ground extends infinitely to the north and to the south, and there are seams on
the east and west ends; so the northern block can slide southward, and the southern block can slide
northward. The right diagram shows the gap closed.
Here is another example. The ravine in the left diagram cannot be closed perfectly by sliding the
ground northward and southward. The right diagram shows the result of the best effort: there is still
a hole.
Write a program to determine if the gap can be closed. The ground is a grid with rows (a row runs
east-west) and columns (a column runs north-south). Holes are cells on the grid, and the gap consists
of holes.
Input
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
blank line between two consecutive inputs.
The first line contains the number of columns W of the ground to be considered. Then W lines
follow, specifying the boundary of the gap by columns: a line represents a column, and the order of
the lines follows the east-to-west order. Each line contains y1, the north-most row of the gap in this
column, and y2, the south-most row of the gap in this column. Row numbers are integers between -100
and 100 inclusive.
The input specifies a valid gap: the holes separate the ground into exactly a northern block and a
southern block. There are no holes embedded inside a block. There are no islands.
Note: The sample input below corresponds to the first diagram.
Output
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
will be separated by a blank line.
Output the line
yes
if the gap can be closed by sliding blocks north and south; and
no
otherwise.
